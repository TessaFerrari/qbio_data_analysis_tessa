    "# Introduction\n",
    "Welcome to the Intro to Python tutorial! We'll be going over the nuts-and-bolts of the language, as well as some parts of the language especially useful for scientific programming. If you're already familiar with Python, you can skip the basics, and follow along in this jupyter notebook!\n",
    "\n",
    "To run code in the Jupyter Notebook, you can click on the Run button (on the top header part), or type CTRL+Enter/CMD+Enter (for Macs/Windows, respectively). It will run the entire block of code -- there is no way to run a single line at a time.\n",

    "# The Basics\n",
    "Python is much more similar to a \"normal\" programming language (e.g. C++, Java) than R, so if you're gone through the core CS courses you're probably going to be a lot more comfortable with Python. Here's a quick runthrough of the syntax used to implement \"standard\" programming procedures. Basically, Python tries to make things as easy as possible -- if something looks like it should work, it'll probably work.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Unique Python Syntax: Indentation\n",
    "In the other programming languages you've used before, such as R, you have defined code blocks using curly braces. Python is completely different, in that it uses **indentation** to demark a new code block. You'll see this in the looping, control flow, and function parts of the guide. This means that Python forces you to maintain nicely readable code.\n",

    "## Defining Variables\n",
    "There's nothing particularly interesting for defining a variable; just use the equals sign. Like R, you can't declare a variable as a specific type as you do in C++."

    "## Array Data Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, you will have worry less about vectorized operations (though they're still much faster -- more on that in the scientific computation section). However, there's four main types of array data structures (collections) in base Python: lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries.\n",
    "* `lists` are your standard array data structure in Python (being ordered and changeable). **These are the ones that you'll use the most**. You declare them using square brackets (`my_list = [1, 2, 3]`).\n",
    "* `tuples` are like `lists`, but they are **unchangeable**. They're helpful if you're optimizing code to maximize runtime, though you can in most cases just use `lists`. You declare them using parentheses. (`my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)`).\n",
    "* `sets` are **unordered**, **unchangeable** collections. Also, you can't have duplicates in them. Again, you can probably ignore the existence of sets and just use lists most of the time. You declare them using curly brackets (`my_set = {1, 2, 3}`).\n",
    "* `dictionaries` are an associative data structure, having a `key` and `value` tuple (if you've taken 104, they're `maps`/hash tables). Essentially, they're a `set` (the key), where each element in the set is paired with some value. As such, they're also defined using curly brackets (`my_dict = {1:\"one\", 2:\"two\", 3:\"three\"}`). You're most likely to use these to associate some input with an output, and as such are very useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A Foreword: Objects\n",
    "We've managed to avoid talking about objects in the context of R, but Python makes us understand what objects are (because **literally everything** in Python is an object, including packages and functions). Very abstractly, an `object` is a specially-defined data type, and it has the following two attributes (i.e. it stores the following information):\n",
    "* Data attributes: these store variables.\n",
    "* Methods: these are functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "To access data attributes, use `object_name.attribute` (note the lack of parentheses). To call a function from an object, use `object_name.function()` (note that these have parentheses). We'll see this soon when working with lists, which are, in fact, examples of objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Accessing Values\n",
    "To access the element at a specific index in a list, use square brackets (`first_list[1]` is `1`, for example). *Note Python is 0-indexed, like most other languages and unlike R.*  This means that `first_list[1]` is the *second* element in the lsit).\n",
    "\n",
    "To get a range of values, use the colon (`:`). Note that the range is inclusive of the first index, but not of the second (as is standard in Python)."
